        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>I have been playing guitar on and off for 30 years or so. A few years ago I decided to get back into it and buy myself a nice guitar. After looking around and playing all the high end guitars I could get my hands on, I discovered most guitars are only made of three kinds of wood: Mahogany or East Indian Rosewood for the back and sides, and Sitka spruce for the tops.</p>
        <p>There are so many kinds of wood that are so much more interesting than these traditional offerings. Cocobolo, African Blackwood, and Padauk are just a few that make excellent back and sides. Red spruce, Western Red Cedar, and Sinker Redwood all make great looking and sounding tops. So many possibilities, but only a couple of options to choose from in the real world.</p>
        <p>After buying and selling several high end guitars, I started to entertain the idea of building my own guitar. I did a lot of research and the thought of building different styles of guitars out of several different species of wood in different combinations began to pique my interest. While reading every book on lutherie and absorbing every bit of information available, I became obsessed with the whole idea.</p>
        <p>I finally started my first guitar, a <a href="padauk.html">dreadnought</a> with Padauk back and sides and Bear Claw Spruce top. About a year later I had 2 guitars finished. The feeling of accomplishment was overwhelming. Being able to express myself artistically is very satisfying and playing my creations for the first time is such a great feeling. I've kept photographic records of all my guitar builds. I've even kept track of the first song played on each guitar! Wouldn't you like to know what the very first song ever played on your guitar was?</p>
        <p>I haven't been trying to sell them yet. I just like building, not selling, but my wife Lina is starting to complain about all the guitars kicking around. I have delegated a room just for guitars. If I brought home a couple of thousand dollars things would calm down a bit around here, so yes, I would reluctantly sell them, but for now I don't care either way. I play all of them.</p>
        <p>I plan to build 4 guitars and 1 ukulele this year. I have to use up some of the cool wood I've been accumulating. When I finally have too many guitars I will bring them to guitar stores to sell on consignment. Let them worry about the sales so I can concentrate on building more guitars!</p>
